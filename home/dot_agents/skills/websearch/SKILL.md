# Websearch (ketch)

Use the `ketch` CLI for web search, page scraping, and docs retrieval.

## Search

```bash
ketch search "query"
ketch search "query" --scrape   # include full content of each result
```

## Scrape

```bash
ketch scrape <url>              # one URL to clean markdown
ketch scrape <url1> <url2>      # multiple URLs concurrently
```

## Library docs

```bash
ketch docs --resolve "react"                 # find the library ID first
ketch docs "hooks" --library /org/repo    # search within a known library
```

## Code search

```bash
ketch code "query" --lang ts   # real OSS snippets, optional --lang filter
```

Notes:
- Poor results? Retry once with `ketch search "query" --multi` (federated, slower).
- To save tokens: `--minimal` (url/title only) or `--max-chars 4000`.
- JS-rendered pages are handled automatically (headless browser fallback).
- Add `--json` for structured output, `-l N` to change result limit.
- Backends and browser are already configured. Do not override unless asked.
